You need access to a mumble server, i hard coded a username "gpt" so you might need to change that or allow that user to write to the chat.<br>
Therefore you need an admin user on the mumble server to allow that new user


you will also need to export all these environment variables:
<ol>
OPENAI_API_KEY, MumbleServerPWD, MumbleCertPath, MumbleCertKeyPath, MumbleChannelName, MumbleServer
</ol>
